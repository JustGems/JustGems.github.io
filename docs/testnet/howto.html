                There are many crypto wallets to choose from, but 
                <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> 
                is the most popular. With direct integration on 
                <a href="https://opensea.io/" target="_blank">OpenSea</a> 
                â€” the largest Polygon NFT marketplace and a gallery to 
                view your digital collectibles, MetaMask is also the 
                best choice for beginners.
              </p>

              <p>
                Metamask is a kind of digital wallet, but it is far 
                different from your ordinary digital wallet, Metamask uses 
                and takes advantage of the new blockchain technology, to 
                store, and secure all the information and transactions 
                of its users.
              </p>

              <p>
                Metamask is not only a wallet but also a key, it will 
                serve as a key at some of your transactions online, instead 
                of creating and memorizing some different passwords and 
                accounts and using it on every transaction, Metamask will 
                serve as a universal key that enables you to complete the 
                transaction with just a click of a button, all you need to 
                do is to set up a Metamask Wallet, create your password, 
                memorize your 12 secret phrases (recovery phrase) and it's 
                all done, once the setup is complete, you can do all 
                transaction using your Metamask Wallet with a power of a 
                click.
              </p>

              <h2>1. Download MetaMask Mobile App</h2>

              <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163679456-2a4ce08c-cade-4d1f-a021-2e7be19a2ef0.png" />

              <p>
                To set up MetaMask on a mobile device, you will need to 
                visit either Google Play or the App Store. Here are the 
                official download links for MetaMask:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask/id1438144202">App Store (iOS)</a></li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask">Google Play (Android)</a></li>
              </ul>

              <h2>2. Mobile App Setup</h2>

              <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163681526-afccc08d-0f70-4da3-be98-6db46fc3160b.png" />

              <p>
                Follow the instructions, read through the terms, 
                and click &quot;I Agree&quot; to continue the setup 
                process. 
              </p>

              <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163681484-aad2e11f-42aa-4cd4-a70f-41b9f162844c.png" />

              <p>
                The first step in getting set up with MetaMask is creating 
                a wallet. Click on the &quot;Create a Wallet&quot; button. 
                You will then need to create a password with a minimum of 
                eight characters that you will use to log in to the 
                mobile app in the future.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Secret Backup Phrase</h3>

              <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163681602-3c676239-2610-4b3b-ac11-9eb01e1336b0.png" />

              <p>
                Your Secret Backup Phrase is a way to easily backup and 
                restore your account at any time. It consists of twelve 
                words in a particular sequence. It is essential to 
                memorize this, write it down on a piece of paper and place 
                it in a safe place.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                Without your Secret Backup Phrase, it will be impossible 
                to restore your account. You can download the phrase and 
                store it on an external encrypted hard drive or storage 
                device for added security. We do not recommend copy and 
                pasting it into a notepad and leaving it on your desktop.
                If your computer gets stolen, hacked, or someone finds 
                the file, someone can easily log in to your MetaMask wallet.
              </blockquote>

              <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163681638-3db9ddd5-5211-4536-8038-31711af975f4.png" />

              <p>
                Confirm your Secret Backup Phrase on the next on-screen 
                prompt when you have it safely stored. This step ensures 
                you have the correct phrase on hand in case you need to 
                restore your account. After confirming your Secret Backup 
                Phrase, click on the &quot;All Done&quot; button. You have 
                now created a MetaMask wallet and are connected to the 
                Polygon Mainnet and congratulations you have now your first 
                Metamask Wallet!
              </p>

                  <tr>
                    <td>Network Name</td>

              <h2>1. Choose Your Platform</h2>

              <img width="100%" src="https://mirageportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/metamask-step3.png" />

              <p>
                After clicking the download now button it will lead you to 
                installation options, you can choose from the three operating 
                systems that you want to use Chrome for PC, iOS, and Android.

                Since this tutorial is for laptops, install Metamask on 
                Chrome browser extension, based on the operating system 
                that you are using. The appearance may vary a little but 
                the procedure is almost the same.
              </p>
