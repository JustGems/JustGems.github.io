            years of age. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or
            use the Site.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Sign-in Name; Password; Unique Identifiers</h2>
        <p>
            During the registration process for Registered Users, we may ask you to
            create an account, which includes a sign-in name (“Sign-In Name”), a
            password (“Password”), and certain additional information that will assist
            in authenticating your identity when you log-in in the future (“Unique
            Identifiers”). In case we ask you to create your account, you must provide
            true, accurate, current, and complete information. Each Sign-In Name and
            corresponding Password can be used by only one Registered User, and sharing
            your access credentials with others (especially if they are using your
            credentials to access our proprietary Content (as defined below) is a
            material breach of this Agreement. In such case, you are solely responsible
            for the confidentiality and use of your Sign-In Name, Password, and Unique
            Identifiers, as well as for any use, misuse, or communications entered
            through the Websites using one or more of them. You will promptly inform us
            of any need to deactivate a Password or Sign-In Name, or change any Unique
            Identifier. We reserve the right to delete or change your Password, Sign-In
            Name, or Unique Identifier at any time and for any reason and shall have no
            liability to you for any loss or damage caused by such action.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Fees and Payment</h2>
        <p>
            As consideration for any purchase you make on the Website, you shall pay
            Findere Platform Solutions Inc all applicable fees and taxes. If applicable with respect to

            authorize your credit card, bank account, or other approved payment
            facility you provided during the registration process for the full payment
            of the fees and any applicable taxes, and you hereby consent to the same.
        </p>

            recordings, and other material provided by or on behalf of Findere Platform Solutions Inc
            (collectively referred to as the “Content”). The Content may be owned by us
            or third parties. The Content is protected under both United States and
            foreign laws. Unauthorized use of the Content may violate copyright,

            non-commercial use. Registered Users who have purchased any product or
            service, may download onto their own machines and view any Content
            contained in such purchased product or service for their own personal,
            non-commercial use. Other than as expressly set forth in the immediately
            two prior sentences, you have no other rights in or to the Content (other
            than your own Registered User Content that you post to the Websites), and
            you will not use the Content except as permitted under this Agreement. No
            other use is permitted without the prior written consent of Findere Platform Solutions Inc.
            Findere Platform Solutions Inc retains all right, title, and interest, including all
            intellectual property rights, in and to the Content. You must retain all
            copyright and other proprietary notices contained in the original Content.
            You may not sell, transfer, assign, license, sublicense, or modify the
            Content or reproduce, display, publicly perform, make a derivative version
            of, distribute, or otherwise use the Content in any way for any public or
            commercial purpose. The use or posting of the Content on any other website,
            social media page, or in a networked computer environment for any purpose
            is expressly prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you violate any part of this Agreement, your permission to access and/or
            use the Content and the Websites automatically terminates and you must
            immediately destroy any copies you have made of the Content.

            without our express, written consent for each and every instance.

        <h2>7. Registered User Content; Licenses</h2>
        <p>
            As noted above, the Website provides Registered Users the ability to post
            and upload Registered User Content. You expressly acknowledge and agree
            that once you submit your Registered User Content for inclusion into the
            Website, it will be accessible by others, and that there is no
            confidentiality or privacy with respect to such Registered User Content,
            including, without limitation, any personally identifying information that
            you may make available. YOU, AND NOT JUST GEMS (FINDERE INC), ARE ENTIRELY
            RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL YOUR REGISTERED USER CONTENT THAT YOU UPLOAD, POST,
            EMAIL, OR OTHERWISE TRANSMIT VIA THE WEBSITES.
        </p>
        <p>
            You retain all copyrights and other intellectual property rights in and to
            your own Registered User Content. You do, however, hereby grant us and our

            license to modify, compile, combine with other content, copy, record,
            synchronize, transmit, translate, format, distribute, publicly display,

            media, or technology now known or hereafter devised. You also grant us and
            our sublicensees the right, but not the obligation, to use your Registered
            User Content, your Sign-In Name, name, likeness, and photograph in
            connection with any use of the related Registered User Content permitted by
            the previous sentence and/or to advertise and promote the Website, JUST
            GEMS, Findere Platform Solutions Inc, and our products and services. Without limiting the
            foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that uses of your Registered User
            Content, name, likeness, and photograph permitted by the foregoing rights
            and licenses may include the display of such Registered User Content, name,

            have the rights necessary to grant the license to the Registered User
            Content under the prior paragraph, and that it and its use by JUST GEMS

            The digital assets about which information is provided on the Site and any
            information provided in connection with the Services or Privileges provided
            to NFT owners are not viewed by the issuer or sponsor of any such digital
            assets, or those buying or selling the digital asset, as securities under
            applicable laws. As a result, it is unlikely that fulsome disclosures from
            the issuer or sponsor, or any executive officer associated with the digital
            asset or related protocol have been provided, and others may have better or
            more information than the information made available to you via the Site,

            There are risks associated with purchasing and holding digital assets. Loss
            of the full amount of the purchase price is possible. Volatility is highly
            likely, and some of the protocols and platforms may fail entirely due to
            forking, flaws in the code, hacking or other malicious attacks.
